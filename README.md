# IndexMapping 

This library contains tools that helps indexing arrays from 
`1d array` (C buffer data type) to 3d array and reciprocally.
The functions `to1d` and `to3d` are complementary and can be
resume with the following statment :
```
If we know the index value of a buffer (index), find the 
equivalent position in a 3d array (x, y, z) and reciprocally; 
such as :
```

- `to3d` buffer[index]     --> 3d array[x, y, z]
- `to1d` 3d array[x, y, z] --> buffer[index]

`to1d & to3d` can also be used to convert 1d array -> 3d array
and vice versa. The library also includes functions to transpose
C buffer data type like the numpy transpose function used for 
multi-dimensional arrays.

How can we transpose row and columns in a 1d array since 
a buffer is a contiguous or non-contiguous adjacent set of data?

1) reshape the 1d array to a 3d equivalent format 
2) swap row and column of the equivalent 3d array (transposed) 
3) Convert the 3d array back to 1d array type (flatten)

This library provide functions such as` vfb_rgb` & `vfb_rgba` 
(for transparency) to transpose the array directly.

```
Below a good example with 9 pixels buffer:
// Original 9 pixels buffer (length = 27), pixel format RGB 
(contiguous values)
buffer = [RGB1, RGB2, *RGB3, RGB4, RGB5, RGB6, RGB7, RGB8, 
RGB9]

Equivalent reshape model (w, h, depth) would be (3x3x3):
3d model = [RGB1 RGB2 *RGB3*]
           [RGB4 RGB5  RGB6 ]
           [RGB7 RGB8  RGB9 ]

// Same 1d buffer after transposing the values (swapped 
row and column)
buffer = [RGB1, RGB4, *RGB7*, RGB2, RGB5, RGB8, RGB3, RGB6, 
RGB9]

Equivalent reshape model (w, h, depth) after transposing the
original buffer
3D model = [RGB1, RGB4, RGB7]
           [RGB2, RGB5, RGB8]
           [RGB3, RGB6, RGB9]
```
After transposing the buffer we can observed that the 3d 
equivalent model is an array with `row & columns swapped`. 
This operation would be identical to a numpy transpose 
function such as : 3darray `transpose(1, 0, 2)`

## Building cython code
```
If you need to compile the Cython code after any changes in the 
file Mapping.pyx:

1) open a terminal window
2) Go in the main project directory where (mapping.pyx & 
   mapping.pxd files are located)
3) run : python setup_Mapping.py build_ext --inplace

If you have to compile the code with a specific python 
version, make sure to reference the right python version 
in (python38 setup_mapping.py build_ext --inplace)

If the compilation fail, refers to the requirement section and 
make sure cython and a C-compiler are correctly install on your
 system.
- A compiler such visual studio, MSVC, CGYWIN setup correctly on 
  your system.
  - a C compiler for windows (Visual Studio, MinGW etc) install 
  on your system and linked to your windows environment.
  Note that some adjustment might be needed once a compiler is 
  install on your system, refer to external documentation or 
  tutorial in order to setup this process.e.g https://devblogs.
